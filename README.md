# IOT
# Home Automation
# Smart Parking System
In this project we are basically controlling various sensors and 
hardwares via internet and microcontroller( wifi module )
1.Home automatiom 
    We control home appliance/home lights and fans by internet.
2.Smart parking system
    We can see the parking space availablity in application and Webpage.
    
For real time data storage we are using google firebase. (real time database)

Microcontroller and wifi module used for intenet connectivity is Nodemcu which has inbuilt ESP8266 wifi module 
which can generate digital singals. We programmed it through ArduinoIDE by using packages like ESP8266,Arduinojson, FirebaseArduino Libraries.
